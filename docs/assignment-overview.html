                    not a lot) about using special github features (like issues), no terminal experience, and no npm
                    experience. You are my mentor web developer with much experience. You are kind, patient and
                    thoughtful. You want to teach me in a way that I come away with learning new concepts and am not
                    frustrated by being overwhelmed. We are looking at this repo together as my first web dev ii
                    assignment. Give me a report as if you are explaining how I am going to get the assignment done,
                    explaining to me new concepts and such. STart by writing this prompt I have just given to you in the
                    report. Make sure it is verbatim.</p>

                    <p>Let's take a deep breath and look at what you're going to accomplish together. This project is
                        called "Abracadabra" and it's designed to teach you some fundamental web development tools in a
                        fun, magical way.</p>

                    <h3>What you're building</h3>
                    <p>You'll transform a boring corporate website into something awesome using professional development
                        tools. The magic happens when you learn to use npm (a tool that manages code packages) and
                        GitHub Issues (a way to organize work).</p>

                    <h3>Why this matters</h3>
                    <p>Every professional web developer uses these tools daily. You're learning the same workflow that
                        developers at companies like Google, Netflix, and startups use.</p>

                                you with one command.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts Explained Simply</h2>

            <div class="concept-explanation">
                <h3>What's a "port"?</h3>
                <p>Think of ports like different doors to your computer. Port 3000 is just a specific door where your
                    website will be available. When you type <code>localhost:3000</code> in your browser, you're saying
                    "show me what's behind door 3000."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-explanation">
                <h3>What's "localhost"?</h3>
                <p>This is just a special address that means "my own computer." So <code>localhost:3000</code> means
                    "show me what's on my computer, through door 3000."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-explanation">
                <h3>Why does the magic only work on port 3000?</h3>
                <p>The JavaScript code is smart! It checks what port you're using and only shows the transformed version
                    on port 3000. This teaches you about environment detection - making your code behave differently in
                    different situations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-explanation">
                <h3>What are npm scripts?</h3>
                <p>These are shortcuts you can create to run complex commands easily. Instead of remembering long
                    commands, you can just type <code>npm run dev</code> and it runs everything you need.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="evidence-portfolio">
            <h2>Your Evidence Portfolio</h2>

            <p>As you work, you'll take screenshots to prove you completed each step. This is like keeping a photo

                    <p>Remember, every professional developer was once exactly where you are now. The terminal seemed
                        scary,
                        npm was confusing, and all these tools felt overwhelming. But here's the secret: you're learning
                        the
                        same fundamental tools that power websites you use every day.</p>

                    <p>This assignment is designed to be achievable while teaching you real professional skills. Take
                        your
                        time, ask questions, and celebrate each small victory. When you see that boring ACME website
                        transform into the colorful "Abracadabra Cow!" page, you'll have experienced the same
                        satisfaction
                        that developers feel when their automation tools work perfectly.</p>

                        time.
